# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


**Features:**

- I can drag and drop tasks/cards from one status to another.
- I can add tasks using the "New" button under any status.
- Clicking on a task should open a new page, where I can change the title, status, and description. I can also delete a task from the details page.
- Store information in localstorage 
- Display count of cards under each status.
